## Ticket Booking App (ReactJS Hands-on) 

## Surendar N

This is a simple ReactJS application that demonstrates conditional rendering based on user login state. 
It is created as part of the ReactJS Hands-On Lab to practice core concepts like element variables, preventing component rendering, and conditional rendering.

---

## Features:

* Displays Guest Page by default.
* When the user clicks Login, it shows the User Page.
* When the user clicks Logout, it returns to the Guest Page.
* Uses useState() to control login state.
* Demonstrates conditional rendering in React.

---


## Prerequisites:

* Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
* Visual Studio Code
---

## Installation & Running the App:

1. Open terminal (Command Prompt / PowerShell)

2. Navigate to your desired folder

3. Run the following commands:

   npx create-react-app ticketbookingapp
   cd ticketbookingapp

4. Create and add your components:

   * GuestPage.js
   * UserPage.js
   * LoginControl.js

5. Replace App.js with your updated version using LoginControl

6. Start the app with:

   npm start

7. The app will open in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Testing:

If you keep the App.test.js file, update it to reflect the new structure.

If you don't plan to use testing now, just delete App.test.js to avoid errors.

## Concepts Practiced:

* Conditional Rendering using useState
* Component-based UI Design
* Handling Login/Logout View Changes
* Preventing Unwanted Component Rendering

---

## Conclusion:
All objectives of the ReactJS Hands-On Lab are completed:
* Explained conditional rendering
* Used element variables
* Prevented rendering using logic
