## Exercise 4: Financial Forecasting

## Scenario:
To build a basic forecasting tool, you needed to calculate projected future values based on initial financial data and historical growth, using a recursive method.

## Steps Taken:

## 1.Exploring Recursion:
Studied the recursive approach for solving problems where the output of one step is dependent on the previous step, such as financial projections over time.

## 2.Designing the Forecast Function:
A recursive method was created to compute future values using a starting amount and a fixed growth rate applied over a given number of periods.

## 3.Building the Recursive Model:
Implemented the recursive logic to call itself for each time period until the target future point was reached, effectively simulating compound growth.

## 4.Analyzing Efficiency:
Identified that the time complexity of the recursive solution grows linearly with the number of periods. Discussed the use of optimization techniques like memoization or iterative conversion to improve performance and avoid stack overflow for large datasets.

## Output:

A functional recursive model was developed to predict financial values. While recursion offered simplicity in implementation, its limitations for large datasets were acknowledged and addressed with potential improvements for real-world scalability.
