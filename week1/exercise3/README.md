## Exercise 3: E-commerce Platform Search Function
## Scenario:
The task was to develop an efficient product search feature for an e-commerce platform, considering the performance implications of different search algorithms.

## Steps Taken:
## 1.Understanding Algorithm Analysis:
Explored Big O notation to evaluate the efficiency of search algorithms in terms of time complexity. Discussed how best-case, average-case, and worst-case scenarios affect performance.

## 2.Product Class Setup:
A Product class was defined with properties like product ID, name, and category. Arrays were used to simulate product data storage.

## 3.Implementing Search Methods:
Two algorithms were developed:

Linear search for unsorted product lists.

Binary search for sorted arrays of products, offering faster lookup.

## 4.Comparative Analysis:
Evaluated the performance differences between linear (O(n)) and binary (O(log n)) search. Binary search was identified as more efficient for large, sorted datasets, making it ideal for real-time product lookups on an e-commerce platform.

## Output:

Both search methods were successfully implemented and tested. Binary search demonstrated significantly better performance for larger and sorted product lists, making it the more appropriate choice for the e-commerce platform's search feature.
